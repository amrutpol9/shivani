The neglect of the mind, the seat of intellect, breeds a state of perpetual flux and discontent. However, transcending the fickleness of the mind lies the realm of intellect, the beacon of wisdom that guides us through life’s tumultuous seas

Which is more important: the objects we desire, or the senses through which we experience them? The senses are actually more important than the objects themselves. For instance, your eyes are more valuable than a television, your ears more precious than music, and your tongue more important than delicious food. Our skin, too, is more crucial than the things we touch.

But what do fools do? They do not realize this truth and give more importance to sense objects than the senses. They know that looking at the TV for too long harms their eyesight yet they continue watching television for hours. They understand that overeating is bad for their health, yet they prioritize food over their well-being. Knowing that our senses are more important than the objects of senses is the first step.

The mind is even more important than the senses. Often, we do things without being fully present-our minds are elsewhere. In such a state, our actions lose their meaning, and we become depressed. When the mind is neglected and only the senses and their objects are cared for, depression sets in. Depression arises from prioritizing material desires over the needs of the mind. If you want certain type of food, and you don’t get that, you feel low. The fool attends to the senses over the mind.
